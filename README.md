# 📝 Notes App

A full stack notes application built with **React**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. Created as a learning project to understand backend CRUD operations, REST APIs, and monolithic deployment (serving a React frontend from an Express backend).

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Create new notes with a title and description
- ✏️ Edit existing notes
- 🗑️ Delete notes
- 💾 Data persisted in MongoDB
- 🎨 Clean dark UI with smooth modal animations

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React (Vite)
- Axios (HTTP requests)
- CSS (custom dark theme)

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express 4
- MongoDB + Mongoose

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tajindervirk/Notes.git
cd Notes
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=3000
```

### 4. Run the server
```bash
node server.js
```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🏗️ Monolithic Deployment

This project uses a **monolithic deployment** approach — the React frontend is built and served directly from the Express backend on the same port.

To rebuild the frontend and update the `public` folder:
```bash
# In your frontend directory
npm run build
# Then copy the dist/ contents into the Backend/public/ folder
```

The backend serves the built frontend using:
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'public')))

app.use('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'public', 'index.html'))
})
```

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building a REST API with full **CRUD operations** using Express & MongoDB
- Handling **wildcard routes** to support client-side routing
- **Monolithic deployment** — serving a React production build from an Express server on a single port
- Connecting React frontend to a backend API using **Axios**
- Managing UI state with a single `modalNote` state to handle both **create and edit** in one modal
